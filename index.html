            Hello there! My name is Iris Ding and I am a current sophomore at
            the Univeristy of Wisconsin-Madison studying Psychology and Data Science.
            This website serves as a collection of my current and previous projects,
            as well as snipets of my life I'd like to share with the world. Thank you
            for taking the time to get to know me :)
