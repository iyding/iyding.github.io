    <h1>Ivy League Sports Analytics Project</h1>
    <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
    <p>As a member of UW-Madison's Dotdata club, I participated in a two 
        month long sports analytics project, where we were assigned to groups
        ranging anywhere from 4 to 8 members and tasked with the responsibility
        of webscraping player data from the official univeristy althetic rosters,
        cleaning the data, and reporting any interesting trends.
